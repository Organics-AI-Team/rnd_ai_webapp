## How to Request a Pitch Deck

When requesting a pitch deck, provide as much detail as possible. I'll adapt to whatever information you give me, but the more context, the better the result.

### Essential Information

**Product Details**:
- Product name (or working name)
- Product category (serum, cream, cleanser, sunscreen, etc.)
- Key benefit or claim (anti-aging, brightening, acne treatment, etc.)
- Unique selling proposition (what makes it special?)

**Target Audience**:
- **Retailers** (Sephora, Ulta, beauty specialty stores)
- **OEM/ODM Partners** (manufacturers looking for formulas)
- **Brand Owners** (private label, white label opportunities)
- **Distributors** (market expansion partners)

**Deck Type**:
- **Full Deck** (12 slides) - Comprehensive presentation for major pitches
- **Quick Pitch** (5-6 slides) - Time-constrained meetings
- **Technical Deep-Dive** (science-focused) - R&D teams, regulatory
- **Executive Summary** (business-focused) - C-suite, investors

### Optional But Helpful

- **Timeline/urgency**: When do you need to present?
- **Specific concerns**: Any objections you expect to face?
- **Competitive context**: What are you competing against?
- **Price positioning**: Premium, mid-market, or value?
- **Regulatory claims**: What claims can/can't you make?
- **Sample data**: Clinical results, consumer tests, efficacy studies

## Example Requests

### Good Request (Detailed)
```
Create a full pitch deck for "GlowShield SPF 50+" - an anti-pollution sunscreen
targeting Sephora buyers. Key USP is our patented blue light protection complex
combined with broad-spectrum SPF. We have 8-week clinical data showing 40%
reduction in oxidative stress markers. Premium positioning at $42/50ml.
Main competitor is Supergoop but we have stronger pollution protection.
```

### Acceptable Request (Minimal)
```
Make a quick pitch for an anti-aging serum with peptides for OEM partners
```

I can work with both, but the detailed request will produce a more targeted, compelling deck.

## Iterating on the Deck

After I create the initial deck, you can refine it:

**Slide-Level Edits**:
- "Make slide 3 more technical"
- "Simplify the science on slide 4"
- "Add pricing comparison to slide 9"

**Tone Adjustments**:
- "Make it more premium/aspirational"
- "Focus more on ROI and margins"
- "Add more urgency/scarcity"

**Audience Pivots**:
- "Adapt this deck for distributors instead of retailers"
- "Create a technical version for R&D review"

**Content Additions**:
- "Add a slide about sustainability credentials"
- "Include our manufacturing certifications"
- "Expand on the clinical data"

## Using RAG Data

I have access to your ingredient database and can:
- Pull real ingredient specifications (INCI names, CAS numbers, suppliers)
- Reference actual stock levels and pricing
- Include technical details (solubility, stability, compatibility)
- Cite real formulation examples from your database

**To use RAG data effectively, mention**:
- Specific ingredients you want to feature
- Technical claims that need substantiation
- Formula constraints (e.g., "natural only", "paraben-free")

**Example**:
```
Create a pitch deck for a vitamin C serum using our Ascorbyl Glucoside
from Hayashibara. Include stability data and compare to L-Ascorbic Acid.
```

I'll automatically query the database for:
- Ascorbyl Glucoside specs and pricing
- Available L-Ascorbic Acid alternatives
- Relevant formulation notes
- Supplier information

## Output Format

I'll deliver the deck in structured markdown format:

```markdown
# SLIDE 1: [Slide Title]

**Headline**: Your attention-grabbing headline

**Subheadline**: Supporting context

**Key Points**:
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

**Visual Direction**:
[Description for designers - imagery, layout, color palette]

**Speaker Notes**:
[What to say when presenting this slide, including transitions]

**Duration**: 45s
```

You can:
- Copy-paste directly into PowerPoint/Keynote/Google Slides
- Share with designers who will create the visuals
- Use speaker notes during rehearsal
- Time your presentation with duration estimates

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about the audience**: Retailers care about sell-through, OEMs care about margins
2. **Mention existing materials**: "We have before/after photos" or "clinical data available"
3. **Share objections you've faced**: Helps me preemptively address concerns
4. **Indicate presentation context**: Board meeting vs. trade show vs. one-on-one
5. **Let me know constraints**: "Must be under 10 minutes" or "Can't discuss pricing yet"

## What I Can't Do

- Create actual slide designs (I provide visual direction for designers)
- Access external databases or competitor websites
- Make unsubstantiated claims (I'll flag if claims need clinical support)
- Present the deck for you (but I'll give you great speaker notes!)

## Follow-up Services

After the deck, I can help with:
- Creating follow-up emails using the **Follow-up Generator** tool
- Drafting individual slides with the **Slide Drafter** tool
- Adapting the deck for different audiences
- Creating leave-behind one-pagers
- Writing talk tracks and rehearsal scripts
